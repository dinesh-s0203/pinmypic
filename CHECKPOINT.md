3. **Similarity Matching:** Cosine similarity comparison
4. **Result Filtering:** Configurable threshold-based matching

### API Endpoints
- `/api/face-recognition/find-my-face` - Face matching service
- `/api/user/save-photo` - Save photo to profile
- `/api/user/remove-photo` - Remove photo from profile
- `/api/user/saved-photos` - Get user's saved photos
- `/api/events/*` - Event management
- `/api/admin/*` - Admin operations

### Database Schema
- **Users:** Profile data, admin permissions, saved photos
- **Events:** Event details, photos, access controls
- **Bookings:** Service bookings and status
- **Packages:** Photography service packages

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

### Current Setup
